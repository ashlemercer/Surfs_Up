# Conclusion
Based on these charts, we can tell that there is not a drastic difference in average, minimum, or maximum temperatures between the two months, indicating that there is then not a drastic change in weather year round, which is good for W. Avy's business.

To be safe, it would be best to get the data for precipitation and temperature during known storm seasons in Oahu in order to either avoid those months, or compare how drastic those storms are compared to the norm.
